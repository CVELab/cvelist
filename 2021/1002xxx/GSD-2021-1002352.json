    "description": "Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints resulting in remote code execution against a wide variety of Java applications (e.g. anything logging user controlled strings such as web browser user agents, to chat functionality in Minecraft servers). An attacker who can inject information into a log message or log message parameter can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled (e.g. a user agent string substitution). From log4j 2.15.0 and later, this behavior has been disabled by default. In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property \"log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups\" to “true” or by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class). Java 8u121 (see https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html) protects against remote code execution by defaulting \"com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase\" and \"com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase\" to \"false\". Please note that remote code execution is possible, e.g. \"${jndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}a${lower:p}://loc${upper:a}lhost:1389/rce}\". Please note that exploits have been published on Twitter, Lunasec and GitHub including working exploits for Minecraft Servers (via the chat functionality). Also CloudFlare reports that they are now blocking this attack by default in their WAF rules and are looking to roll our ptoection for free customers as well."
