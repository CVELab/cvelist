    "description": "faker.js had it's version updated to 6.6.6 in NPM and the GitHub repo has been wiped of content. This appears to have been done intentionally as the repo only has a single commit (so it was likjely deleted, recreated and a single commit with \"endgame\" added). It appears that both GitHub and NPM have locked out the original developer accountbut that the faker.js package is still broken. Please note that this issue is directly related to GSD-2022-1000007 and appears to be part of the same incident."
