    "description": "In OpenSSL version 3.0.4 a heap buffer overflow exists in the AVX512 support that can be attacked via network resulting in code execution. This is reachable via four code paths: RSAZ 1024, RSAZ 512, Dual 1024 RSAZ, and Default constant-time Montgomery modular exponentiation. Please note this issue is especially serious as OpenSSL 3.0.4 contains a security fix for CVE-2022-2068 which allows arbitrary code execution. This means that all users of OpenSSL 3 are affected by a number of serious security vulnerabilities."
