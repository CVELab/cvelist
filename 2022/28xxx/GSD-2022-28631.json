An unprivileged user could exploit this vulnerability in an adjacent network to potentially execute arbitrary code in an isolated process resulting in a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability within that process. In addition, an unprivileged user could exploit a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in an isolated process resulting in a complete loss of availability within that process.
