It uses Word's external link to load the HTML and then uses the \"ms-msdt\" scheme to execute PowerShell code. \n\n From Microsoft: A remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT is called using the URL protocol from a calling application such as Word. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application.
