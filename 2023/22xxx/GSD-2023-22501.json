Access to these tokens can be obtained in two cases: * If the attacker is included on Jira issues or requests with these users, or * If the attacker is forwarded or otherwise gains access to emails containing a \u201cView Request\u201d link from these users. Bot accounts are particularly susceptible to this scenario. On instances with single sign-on, external customer accounts can be affected in projects where anyone can create their own account."
