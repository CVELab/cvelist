Nokogiri (the HTML parser Sanitize uses) doesn't support scripting so it follows the \"scripting disabled\" rules, but a web browser with scripting enabled will follow the \"scripting enabled\" rules. This means that Sanitize can't reliably make the contents of a `noscript` element safe for scripting enabled browsers. The safest thing to do is to remove the element and its contents entirely, which is now what Sanitize does in version 6.0.1 and later.",
