# The Go Vulnerability Database

This repository contains the reports for the Go Vulnerability Database.

If you are interested accessing data from the Go Vulnerability Database, see

used for adding new vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a vulnerability

We are not accepting new vulnerability reports at this time. We will update
this README.md once we are ready to receive reports.
