# GSD database

The gsd-database repo is the actual data for identifiers in the Global Security Database in the form of GSD-YEAR-INTEGER. To maintain easier compatibility with the CVE ecosystem we have decided to reserve numbers below 1 million for CVE data, using the same integer to make matching up entries easy.
