description: |
    ReadUvarint and ReadVarint can read an unlimited number of bytes from
    invalid inputs.

    Certain invalid inputs to ReadUvarint or ReadVarint can cause these
    functions to read an unlimited number of bytes from the ByteReader
    parameter before returning an error. This can lead to processing more
    input than expected when the caller is reading directly from a
    network and depends on ReadUvarint or ReadVarint only consuming a
    small, bounded number of bytes, even from invalid inputs.
