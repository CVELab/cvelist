modules:
  - module: std
    versions:
      - fixed: 1.5.4
      - introduced: 1.6.0
        fixed: 1.6.1
    packages:
      - package: crypto/dsa
        symbols:
          - Verify
description: |
    The Verify function in crypto/dsa passed certain parameters unchecked to
    the underlying big integer library, possibly leading to extremely
    long-running computations, which in turn makes Go programs vulnerable to
    remote denial of service attacks.  Programs using HTTPS client certificates
    or the Go SSH server libraries are both exposed to this vulnerability.
