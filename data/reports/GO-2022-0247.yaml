description: |
    When invoking functions from WASM modules, built using GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js,
    passing very large arguments can cause portions of the module to be
    overwritten with data from the arguments due to a buffer overflow error.

    If using wasm_exec.js to execute WASM modules, users will need to replace
    their copy (as described in
    https://golang.org/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started) after rebuilding any
    modules.
