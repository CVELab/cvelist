description: |
    The fasthttp.FS request handler is vulnerable to directory traversal
    attacks on Windows systems, and can serve files from outside the
    provided root directory.

    URL path normalization does not handle Windows path separators
    (backslashes), permitting an attacker to construct requests
    with relative paths.
