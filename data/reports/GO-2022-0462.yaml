description: |
    Client-provided certificates are not correctly validated,
    and must not be trusted.

    DTLS client certificates must be accompanied by proof that the client
    possesses the private key for the certificate. The Pion DTLS server
    accepted client certificates unaccompanied by this proof, permitting
    an attacker to present any certificate and have it accepted as valid.
