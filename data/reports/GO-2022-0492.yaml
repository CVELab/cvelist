description: |
    GitArtifactReader is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.

    The GitArtifactReader.Read function reads and returns the
    contents of a Git repository file. A maliciously crafted repository
    can exploit this to cause Read to read from arbitrary files on
    the filesystem.
