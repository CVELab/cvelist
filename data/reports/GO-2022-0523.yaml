    description: |
        Uncontrolled recursion in Unmarshal in encoding/xml before Go 1.17.12
        and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to cause a panic due to stack
        exhaustion via unmarshalling an XML document into a Go struct which has
        a nested field that uses the 'any' field tag.
