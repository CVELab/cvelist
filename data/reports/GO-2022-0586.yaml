description: |
    Malicious HTTP responses can cause a number of misbehaviors,
    including overwriting local files, resource exhaustion, and panics.

    * Protocol switching, endless redirect, and configuration bypass are
      possible through abuse of custom HTTP response header processing.

    * Arbitrary host access is possible through go-getter path traversal,
      symlink processing, and command injection flaws.

    * Asymmetric resource exhaustion can occur when go-getter processes
      malicious HTTP responses.

    * A panic can be triggered when go-getter processed password-protected ZIP
      files.
