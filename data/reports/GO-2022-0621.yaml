description: |
    Exposing annotations as metrics can leak secrets.

    An experimental feature of kube-state-metrics enables annotations
    to be exposed as metrics. By default, metrics only expose metadata
    about secrets. However, a combination of the default kubectl behavior
    and this new feature can cause the entire secret content to end up
    in metric labels.
