description: |
   Attackers can cause a crash in SSH servers when the server has been
   configured by passing a Signer to ServerConfig.AddHostKey such that
    1) the Signer passed to AddHostKey does not implement AlgorithmSigner, and
    2) the Signer passed to AddHostKey returns a key of type “ssh-rsa” from its
     PublicKey method.

   Servers that only use Signer implementations provided by the ssh package are
   unaffected.
