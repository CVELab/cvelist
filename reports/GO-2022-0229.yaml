description: |
    On 32-bit architectures, a malformed input to crypto/x509 or
    the ASN.1 parsing functions of golang.org/x/crypto/cryptobyte
    can lead to a panic.

    The malformed certificate can be delivered via a crypto/tls
    connection to a client, or to a server that accepts client
    certificates. net/http clients can be made to crash by an HTTPS
    server, while net/http servers that accept client certificates
    will recover the panic and are unaffected.
