description: |
    When a Go program running on a Unix system is out of file descriptors and
    calls syscall.ForkExec (including indirectly by using the os/exec package),
    syscall.ForkExec can close file descriptor 0 as it fails. If this happens
    (or can be provoked) repeatedly, it can result in misdirected I/O such as
    writing network traffic intended for one connection to a different
    connection, or content intended for one file to a different one.

    For users who cannot immediately update to the new release, the bug can be
    mitigated by raising the per-process file descriptor limit.
