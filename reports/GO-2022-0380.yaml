description: |
    The AccountClaims.IsRevoked and Export.IsRevoked functions improperly
    validate expired credentials using the current system time rather than
    the issue time of the JWT to be tested.

    These functions cannot be used properly. Newer versions of the jwt package
    provide an IsClaimRevoked method which performs correct validation.
    In these versions, the IsRevoked method always return true.
