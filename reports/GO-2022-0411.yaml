description: |
    Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy
    than expected.

    The RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric functions always return
    strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly
    reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.
