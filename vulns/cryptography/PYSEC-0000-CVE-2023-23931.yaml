id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-23931
details: cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and
  recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept
  Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers.
  This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating
  fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly
  raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally
  introduced in cryptography 1.8.
