id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-32670
package:
  name: datasette
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Datasette is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data.
  The `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does not correctly escape generated
  HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks)
  vulnerability. This vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation
  includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords)
  as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data. Datasette 0.57
  and 0.56.1 both include patches for this issue. If you run Datasette behind a proxy
  you can workaround this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=`
  or `&_trace=` in their query string parameters.
