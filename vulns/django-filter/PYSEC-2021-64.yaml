  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in django-filter
details: django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based on
  user selections. In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically generated
  `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject
  to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently
  large exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value`
  of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter`
  implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator
  instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation.
  Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.
