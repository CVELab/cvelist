id: PYSEC-2019-90
package:
  name: django-rest-registration
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in django-rest-registration
details: verification.py in django-rest-registration (aka Django REST Registration
  library) before 0.5.0 relies on a static string for signatures (i.e., the Django
  Signing API is misused), which allows remote attackers to spoof the verification
  process. This occurs because incorrect code refactoring led to calling a security-critical
  function with an incorrect argument.
