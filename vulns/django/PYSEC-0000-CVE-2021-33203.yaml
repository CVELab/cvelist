id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-33203
package:
  name: django
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Django before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 has a potential
  directory traversal via django.contrib.admindocs. Staff members could use the TemplateDetailView
  view to check the existence of arbitrary files. Additionally, if (and only if) the
  default admindocs templates have been customized by application developers to also
  show file contents, then not only the existence but also the file contents would
  have been exposed. In other words, there is directory traversal outside of the template
  root directories.
