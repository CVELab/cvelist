id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-33571
package:
  name: django
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: In Django 2.2 before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2 before 3.2.4, URLValidator,
  validate_ipv4_address, and validate_ipv46_address do not prohibit leading zero characters
  in octal literals. This may allow a bypass of access control that is based on IP
  addresses. (validate_ipv4_address and validate_ipv46_address are unaffected with
  Python 3.9.5+..) .
