package:
  name: eventlet
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in eventlet
details: Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer
  may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious
  peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame.
  A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround,
  restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion,
  but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.
