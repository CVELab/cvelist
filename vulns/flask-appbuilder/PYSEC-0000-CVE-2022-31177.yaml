id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-31177
details: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top of
  Flask python framework. In versions prior to 4.1.3 an authenticated Admin user could
  query other users by their salted and hashed passwords strings. These filters could
  be made by using partial hashed password strings. The response would not include
  the hashed passwords, but an attacker could infer partial password hashes and their
  respective users. This issue has been fixed in version 4.1.3. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
