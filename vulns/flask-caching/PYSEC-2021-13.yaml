package:
  name: flask-caching
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in flask-caching
details: The Flask-Caching extension through 1.10.1 for Flask relies on Pickle for
  serialization, which may lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation.
  If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis,
  etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python
  code.
