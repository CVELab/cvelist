id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24737
details: HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of
  sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs
  to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before
  3.1.0, HTTPie didnâ€˜t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This
  behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating
  from the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds.
