id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-31020
details: Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for
  decentralized identity. In versions 1.12.4 and prior, the `pool-upgrade` request
  handler in Indy-Node allows an improperly authenticated attacker to remotely execute
  code on nodes within the network. The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node
  1.12.5 has been updated to properly authenticate pool-upgrade transactions before
  any processing is performed by the request handler. The transactions are further
  sanitized to prevent remote code execution. As a workaround, endorsers should not
  create DIDs for untrusted users. A vulnerable ledger should configure `auth_rules`
  to prevent new DIDs from being written to the ledger until the network can be upgraded.
