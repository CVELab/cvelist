summary: Vulnerability in jsonpickle
details: '** DISPUTED ** jsonpickle through 1.4.1 allows remote code execution during
  deserialization of a malicious payload through the decode() function. Note: It has
  been argued that this is expected and clearly documented behaviour. pickle is known
  to be capable of causing arbitrary code execution, and must not be used with un-trusted
  data.'
