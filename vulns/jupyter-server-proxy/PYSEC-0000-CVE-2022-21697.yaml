id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-21697
details: Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy web
  services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server
  extension enabled is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients
  to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication
  is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel
  or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade
  to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, install the patch manually.
