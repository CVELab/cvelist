id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-43818
details: lxml is a library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language. Prior
  to version 4.6.5, the HTML Cleaner in lxml.html lets certain crafted script content
  pass through, as well as script content in SVG files embedded using data URIs. Users
  that employ the HTML cleaner in a security relevant context should upgrade to lxml
  4.6.5 to receive a patch. There are no known workarounds available.
