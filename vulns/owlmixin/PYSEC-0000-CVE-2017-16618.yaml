id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2017-16618
package:
  name: owlmixin
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML loading functionality of
  util.py in OwlMixin before 2.0.0a12. A "Load YAML" string or file (aka load_yaml
  or load_yamlf) can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution
  because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert
  Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
