id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-39207
details: parlai is a framework for training and evaluating AI models on a variety
  of openly available dialogue datasets. In affected versions the package is vulnerable
  to YAML deserialization attack caused by unsafe loading which leads to Arbitary
  code execution. This security bug is patched by avoiding unsafe loader users should
  update to version above v1.1.0. If upgrading is not possible then users can change
  the Loader used to SafeLoader as a workaround. See commit 507d066ef432ea27d3e201da08009872a2f37725
  for details.
