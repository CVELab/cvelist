id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2017-11424
package:
  name: pyjwt
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in `HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key`
  does not account for all PEM encoded public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded
  format would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC
  KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion
  attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow
  an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.
