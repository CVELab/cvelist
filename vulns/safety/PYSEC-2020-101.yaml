id: PYSEC-2020-101
package:
  name: safety
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in safety
details: 'The command-line "safety" package for Python has a potential security issue.
  There are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code to “poison-pill”
  command-line Safety package detection routines by disguising, or obfuscating, other
  malicious or non-secure packages. This vulnerability is considered to be of low
  severity because the attack makes use of an existing Python condition, not the Safety
  tool itself. This can happen if: You are running Safety in a Python environment
  that you don’t trust. You are running Safety from the same Python environment where
  you have your dependencies installed. Dependency packages are being installed arbitrarily
  or without proper verification. Users can mitigate this issue by doing any of the
  following: Perform a static analysis by installing Docker and running the Safety
  Docker image: $ docker run --rm -it pyupio/safety check -r requirements.txt Run
  Safety against a static dependencies list, such as the requirements.txt file, in
  a separate, clean Python environment. Run Safety from a Continuous Integration pipeline.
  Use PyUp.io, which runs Safety in a controlled environment and checks Python for
  dependencies without any need to install them. Use PyUp''s Online Requirements Checker.'
