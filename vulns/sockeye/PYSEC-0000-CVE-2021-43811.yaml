id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-43811
details: Sockeye is an open-source sequence-to-sequence framework for Neural Machine
  Translation built on PyTorch. Sockeye uses YAML to store model and data configurations
  on disk. Versions below 2.3.24 use unsafe YAML loading, which can be made to execute
  arbitrary code embedded in config files. An attacker can add malicious code to the
  config file of a trained model and attempt to convince users to download and run
  it. If users run the model, the embedded code will run locally. The issue is fixed
  in version 2.3.24.
