id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-35918
details: 'Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python.
  Users hosting Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory
  traversal attack that could leak data from their web server file-system such as:
  server logs, world readable files, and potentially other sensitive information.
  An attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would
  process that URL and return the contents of that file or overwrite existing files
  on the web-server. This issue has been resolved in version 1.11.1. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.'
