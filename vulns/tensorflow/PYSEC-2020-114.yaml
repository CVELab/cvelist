  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in tensorflow
details: In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a user passes an invalid
  argument to `dlpack.to_dlpack` the expected validations will cause variables to
  bind to `nullptr` while setting a `status` variable to the error condition. However,
  this `status` argument is not properly checked. Hence, code following these methods
  will bind references to null pointers. This is undefined behavior and reported as
  an error if compiling with `-fsanitize=null`. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8
  and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
