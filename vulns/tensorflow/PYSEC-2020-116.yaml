summary: Vulnerability in tensorflow
details: In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the implementation of `dlpack.to_dlpack`
  can be made to use uninitialized memory resulting in further memory corruption.
  This is because the pybind11 glue code assumes that the argument is a tensor. However,
  there is nothing stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor.
  The uninitialized memory address is due to a `reinterpret_cast` Since the `PyObject`
  is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor, the cast to `EagerTensor` fails. The
  issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released
  in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
