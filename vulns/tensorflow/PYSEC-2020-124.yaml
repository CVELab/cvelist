summary: Vulnerability in tensorflow
details: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation
  does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular,
  there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning
  of the `values` tensor. Hence, the code is prone to heap buffer overflow. If `split_values`
  does not end with a value at least `num_values` then the `while` loop condition
  will trigger a read outside of the bounds of `split_values` once `batch_idx` grows
  too large. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02
  and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.
