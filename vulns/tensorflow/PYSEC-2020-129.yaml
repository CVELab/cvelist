summary: Vulnerability in tensorflow
details: 'In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, changing
  the TensorFlow''s `SavedModel` protocol buffer and altering the name of required
  keys results in segfaults and data corruption while loading the model. This can
  cause a denial of service in products using `tensorflow-serving` or other inference-as-a-service
  installments. Fixed were added in commits f760f88b4267d981e13f4b302c437ae800445968
  and fcfef195637c6e365577829c4d67681695956e7d (both going into TensorFlow 2.2.0 and
  2.3.0 but not yet backported to earlier versions). However, this was not enough,
  as #41097 reports a different failure mode. The issue is patched in commit adf095206f25471e864a8e63a0f1caef53a0e3a6,
  and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.'
