  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in tensorflow
details: In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, when the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize`
  has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan`
  floating point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which
  later produces a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808
  and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages
  after this commit will also have the issue resolved.
