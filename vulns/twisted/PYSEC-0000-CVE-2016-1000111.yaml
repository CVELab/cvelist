id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2016-1000111
package:
  name: twisted
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: Twisted before 16.3.1 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18
  namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence
  of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow
  remote attackers to redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary
  proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.
affects:
  ranges:
  - type: ECOSYSTEM
