id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-42521
details: There is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in VTK, and it lies in
  IO/Infovis/vtkXMLTreeReader.cxx. The vendor didn't check the return value of libxml2
  API 'xmlDocGetRootElement', and try to dereference it. It is unsafe as the return
  value can be NULL and that NULL pointer dereference may crash the application.
