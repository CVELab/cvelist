id: PYSEC-2021-60
package:
  name: wagtail
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in wagtail
details: Wagtail is a Django content management system. In affected versions of Wagtail,
  when saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface, Wagtail does
  not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol. A malicious
  user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request to publish
  content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability is
  not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.
  See referenced GitHub advisory for additional details, including a workaround. Patched
  versions have been released as Wagtail 2.11.7 (for the LTS 2.11 branch) and Wagtail
  2.12.4 (for the current 2.12 branch).
