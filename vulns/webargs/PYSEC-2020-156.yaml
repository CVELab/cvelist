package:
  name: webargs
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in webargs
details: flaskparser.py in Webargs 5.x through 5.5.2 doesn't check that the Content-Type
  header is application/json when receiving JSON input. If the request body is valid
  JSON, it will accept it even if the content type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
  This allows for JSON POST requests to be made across domains, leading to CSRF.
