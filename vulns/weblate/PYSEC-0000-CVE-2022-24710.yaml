id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-24710
details: Weblate is a copyleft software web-based continuous localization system.
  Versions prior to 4.11 do not properly neutralize user input used in user name and
  language fields. Due to this improper neutralization it is possible to perform cross-site
  scripting via these fields. The issues were fixed in the 4.11 release. Users unable
  to upgrade are advised to add their own neutralize logic.
