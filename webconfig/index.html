    <h1>Go Vulnerability Database</h1>
    <p>
      This is the Go vulnerability database. It is meant to be accessed by
      programs that want to find vulnerabilities associated with Go modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The database's API is documented at
      <a href="https://go.dev/security/vuln/database" target="_blank">go.dev/security/vuln/database</a>.
      To simply browse the reports in the database, use
      <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/vuln" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev/vuln</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      See
      <a href="https://go.dev/security/vuln" target="_blank">go.dev/security/vuln</a>
      to learn about Go's Vulnerability Management system, including details on
      how the database is populated, and client libraries and tools that can be
      used to fetch information from the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn about vulncheck, the package which allows developers to scan
      their projects' dependencies to detect public vulnerabilities, see
